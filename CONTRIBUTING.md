# Contributing

Use [Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions) to propose and discuss product and/or technical **requirements**.

Use [Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/issues) to track **well-scoped technical work** that the community agrees should be done at some point.

Open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/pulls) when you want to **contribute work towards an Issue**, or you feel confident that your contribution is desireable and small enough to forego community discussion at the requirements and planning levels.
